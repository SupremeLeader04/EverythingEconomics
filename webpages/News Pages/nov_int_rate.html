            BANK OF ENGLAND BASE RATE REMAINS AT 5.25%
        </h1>

        <hr class="news_default_hr">

        <p id="date">03/11/2023</p>

        <p class="news_default_p">
            For the second time in a row, the Bank of England has decided to keep the Base Rate of interest at 5.25%, which represents a 15-year Base Rate high.
            This decision comes after 14 consecutive Bank Rate rises in just 2-years, in an attempt to curb high inflation. Although down from its peak, UK CPI
            was at a stubborn 6.7% YoY in September, certainly higher than the USA (currently at 3.7%) and the eurozone (4.3% in September). The Bank of England has recently
            halted rate rises, however, waiting to see if previous rises will prove sufficient to bring inflation back to the 2% target. They are also concerned that high interest 
            rates will exacerbate the weakness in UK growth (which has hovered around 0% for most of 2023, though not the worst out of the major G7 economies, given Germany's precarious situation).
        </p>

        <p class="news_default_p">
            The Base Rate forms a key part of the Bank's monetary policy arsenal. The Bank of England has been independent since 1998, and takes responsibility for managing the UK's monetary stability,
            and financial sector health. Monetary policy is a collective term for a set of policies which aim to influence the total money supply in an economy, and by extension, the level of aggregate demand.
            The Base Rate is of paramount importance because of the somewhat peculiar way that modern banking systems work.
        </p>

        <p class="news_default_p">
            When an individual electronically "transfers" money to another, there is actually no physical transfer of funds from the first individual's bank to that of the latter. Instead, there is a transfer of
            central bank reserves from one bank's account at the Bank of England to that of the other. Relatedly, most Western economies operate a financial system centred on the concept of "Fractional Reserve Banking". 
            Under this system, commercial banks are mandated to hold reserves at the central bank at least equivalent in value to a given set proportion of the total deposits at that bank at a given time. In the UK, 
            there is in fact no legally required proportion, but banks have agreed via common consensus to maintain reserves woth around 12% of total deposits. However, as we have discussed, the amount of reserves a bank
            holds in its "central bank" account is in constant flux due to transfers, and so at times, it may fall below the required threshold. Banks will then need to borrow reserves either from each other, or from the 
            Bank of England, in order to cover the shortfall. Of course, as with most forms of borrowing, interest will be charged on these borrowed reserves, and that charged by the Bank of England is what the Base Rate actually
            represents. The Bank of England Base Rate is simply the interest rate the Bank of England charges commercial banks to borrow bank reserves.        
        </p>

        <p class="news_default_p">
            Unfortunately, this simple mechanism is not included in the A-level specification, despite the fact that it underpins the way that the Base Rate ACTUALLY affects the economy. Once this concept is understood,
            it becomes easy to comprehend how commercial bank behaviour changes as a result. For example, interest rates on savings accounts rise as the Base Rate increases. Why? Well, an increase in the Base Rate means that 
            it is MORE COSTLY for money to be withdrawn from a bank, if that means that its reserves temporarily drop below the required level. As a result, banks will wish to incentivise savers to leave their money deposited
            rather than withdrawing it, so they raise interest rates as a result. Similar lines of reasoning can be used for each of the other "interest rate mechanisms" that ARE included in the curriculum.  
        </p>

        <p class="news_last_p">
            In conclusion, the Bank's decision to keep the Base Rate at 5.25% (again) represents a basic concern for how the interest rate mechanism may negatively effect GDP growth, and related KPIs like unemployment. This is 
            explained by the way that the Base Rate actually works, and how it affects commercial bank behaviour, which in turn influences household and firm behaviour, and so aggregate demand and inflation.

                        Website design and functionality was inspired heavily by a

                        of the tutorial, but much has been adapted from/added on to EGATOR's framework. Credit to
